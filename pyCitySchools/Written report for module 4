Summarizes the analysis (5 points)

Draws two correct conclusions or comparisons from the calculations (10 points)


In summary the school distric has 15 total schools, with almost 39200. The total budget bewteen all schools is almost 24,700,000
with the average student getting almost 79% on math and almost a 82% on reading. The average overall passing is little over 65%
BOTH passing math and reading. 

In summary sean as the top schools dataframe, and the bottom schools dataframe. The best 8 schools are charter while the bottom 7 
are district. with district overall passing rate for both math and reading only are between 52 and 55 percent. While chater
has a passing rate of 89 to 92 passing rate. Nearly 35% better passing rate for the chater schools. This might because of budget
issues or money issues. thats not correct, District schools speend more on PER STUDNET then the charter. The issue COULD be 
school size. all the district schools have class size in the large range rather then the charter that has medium. the
exception to the rull is Wilson High with size of Large and Holden High with the size of small. Smaller classes sizes allow
for better custom learing. With better learning come's most likey a better scores on reading and math.
